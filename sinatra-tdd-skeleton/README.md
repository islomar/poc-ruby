# Sinatra skeleton

The goal of this folder is to serve as template for a brand new Sinatra project, being ready for an Outside-In TDD approach, following an Interaction-Driven Design perspective.

* The existance of the `config.ru` allows starting up the Sinatra app with `bundle exec rackup`


## How to run the tests
Run `rake`

## How to run the Sinatra pp
Run `bundle exec rackup`
