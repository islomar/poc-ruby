# Sinatra skeleton

The goal of this folder is to serve as template for a brand new Sinatra project, being ready for an Outside-In TDD approach, following an Interaction-Driven Design perspective.

* When the app grows, it will be better to create domain-focus folders for actions, model, etc.
* Mimic the business folders structure into the test folders structure (i.e. actions, model, etc).

## How to run the tests
Run `rake`

## How to run the Sinatra pp
Run `bundle exec rackup`
