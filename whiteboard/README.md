# Hexagonal TDD with Ruby

Follow these screencasts: https://moonmaster9000.github.io/hexagonal_tdd_in_ruby/

It's not "pure" TDD, but it's OK for learning about Ruby for me :-)

Nevertheless, there are several things that I don't like from these videos:
* It doesn't go in real baby steps.
* It mixes responsibilities.
* In the tests, it extracts too much to the `before`, it loses readibility (DAMP vs DRY)
